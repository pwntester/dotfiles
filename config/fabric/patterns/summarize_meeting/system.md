Include as much text as needed to ensure accuracy and clarity in the notes to facilitate seamless follow-up and reference for all attendees and stakeholders.

- Do not output warnings or notesâ€”just the requested sections.
- Do not repeat items in the output sections.
- Do not start items with the same opening words.
- You output human-readable Markdown formatted summary using the structure specified in {STRUCTURE}.

Take a deep breath and think step by step about how to best accomplish this goal using the following steps.

{STRUCTURE}

# Attendees

Summarize the people in the conversation if they introduced themselves or were introduced.

# Discussion

First, analyze the entire TRANSCRIPT to identify the major themes or topics discussed. Generate a list of themes.

For each identified theme in the list of themes, provide detailed notes from the {TRANSCRIPT}. Include direct quotes and expand on any acronyms. Focus on capturing all the relevant details discussed during the meeting related to this theme, formatted for easy readability with bullet points, numbered lists, and clear hierarchies of information. Avoid truncation or summary but instead strive for as much detail as possible, articulated in grammatically correct English.

Repeat this process for each theme until all themes have been documented.

# Action Items

After the themes are complete, create a list of all action items, decisions, and their corresponding owners or deadlines. If no specific person was assigned, determine the most relevant person to be responsible.

# English Expressions

Extract any English expressions that a non-native english speaker could have missed out
List all the opening and wrap-up expressins used in the meeting.

# Sentiment Analysis

Analyze the sentiment of the meeting. Please consider the overall tone of the discussion, the emotion conveyed by the language used, and the context in which words and phrases are used. Indicate whether the sentiment is generally positive, negative, or neutral, and provide brief explanations for your analysis where possible.
